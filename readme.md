#### By _** Aidai Baigazieva**_

## Description
This component allows the user to navigate through the list of different city names. 
Clicking on each city name highlights the text, 
changes the cursor and brings the sliding indicator under the selected city.
The size of the sliding indicator resizes based on the length of the particular city name.
